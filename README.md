# Memory Game

Welcome to Memory Game, a concentration game where, instead of using playing cards, a user flips browser-based squares to uncover FontAwesome Icons such as Bitcoin, Pied Piper, Ambulance, Space Shuttle, and more!

This game serves as my final project for Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanogegree with a Front End Development specialization.


## Rules:

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. Each turn:

1. A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol

2. The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol

3. If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over

4. If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state

5. The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
